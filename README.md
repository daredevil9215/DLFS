# Deep Learning From Scratch

## Overview

This repository contains some popular deep learning architectures which are implemented using NumPy, without popular libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow.

Architectures currently implemented are:

- Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)

- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

- Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

- Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)

## Setup

1. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
